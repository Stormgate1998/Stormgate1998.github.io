            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Peel potatoes and beets, cut into whatever size you prefer. If your chosen ingredients need the same treatment, do it now. Cut the meat into pieces, but not too small, it is still meat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boil water in metal cauldron over wooden fire for best results. Or just boil it however you can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once water boils, dump in potatoes, beets and meat
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the potatoes can be squished on the side with your spoon, add the spices.
                </li>
                <li>Let sit for 3 hours, reduce heat</li>
                <li>Done. Serves a family of 5, unless your family is weak. Then it serves a family of 5 for the winter.</li>
